# Inverse Reinforcement learning on Acrobot (Double Pendulum) Environment
 
## Setup

I have used [rlpyt](https://github.com/astooke/rlpyt) for finding optimal policies for different reward functions. It is instantiated as a submodule. So you'll have to recursively clone this repository and then build rlpyt.

```
$ git clone --recurse https://github.com/Vrroom/IRL.git
$ cd IRL/rlpyt
$ python3 setup.py install
# cd .. && python3 IRL.py
```
